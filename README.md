# Overview
In today’s  fast paced lifestyle, people often consume meals without understanding their nutritional components and values. Lack of awareness leads to imbalanced diet, unhealthy eating habits, and long term health issues. while some app focuses on the the calorie intake, they generally do not focus on the nutritional values and the feedback required to maintain the balance diet.
