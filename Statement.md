## Problem statement
In today’s  fast paced lifestyle, people often consume meals without understanding their nutritional components and values. Lack of awareness leads to imbalanced diet, unhealthy eating habits, and long term health issues. while some app focuses on the the calorie intake, they generally do not focus on the nutritional values and the feedback required to maintain the balance diet. 
So there is a need of simple app which can provide the accurate nutritional information for daily meals, helping individuals to prepare their dietary meal properly and to implement the healthy eating habits in their their daily life.

## Scope of the project
The scope of this project is not only limited to provide the composition but also the full analysis including the graphs and the feedback section. It focuses more on breaking the product into its chemical composition and macronutrients and micronutrients including fats, carbohydrates, proteins and calories. Not only a sports person but also the working professionals and small children can use this app so to keep track of what are they consuming and in what portion. In future, this app can be modified and updated and even new features can be added so to enhance the performance and to make it reach to common people easily.

## Target users
*	Students, who need a simple tool to understand the importance of healthy diet and also to understand food chemistry
*	Fitness enthusiast, who need to maintain the balance diet regularly
*	General users, are the one who likes to keep track of  what they eat and check what their food contain.
* Beginners in programming, who want to explore the programming language and the one who is interested in making new application and to learn new things.
